				<p>
As an Autonomous Robots System Engineer, you will become a pivotal member of the control team.
You will work closely with other researchers and engineers of the centre to design, develop and integrate the robotic control, planning, and decision-making algorithms that empower ground, aerial, marine, and manipulator robots with autonomy. Your main role will be system-level software development, enhancement and integration of the different components contributing to the robot's autonomy stack, such as state estimation, low-level control, trajectory following and generation, while in close synergy with the perception pipeline.
                </p>

                <p>
                You should prove accountable and independent  and should be able to work in a team too. A good understanding of robotic fundamentals and algorithms is a must.
If you would like to be part of our multi-disciplinary team, apply today by reaching out to us.
