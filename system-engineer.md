				The Autonomous Robots System Engineer is a pivotal member that will work across different teams in the Autonomous Robotics Research Centre (ARRC) at Technology Innovation Institute (TII) - Abu Dhabi. The candidate will focus on performing system-level integration of perception and control components coming from different sources, on different robotics platforms, with special focus on aerial vehicles (quadrotors and VTOLs). He will also be in charge to integrate and/or enhance the state estimation, control and perception capabilities of the algorithms running on these platforms. Importantly, some of these components could consist of cutting-edge research, which also means a low technology readiness level (TRL). As part of this role, the system engineer will be in charge to test those high-research-content components in order to bring the TRL to a level that is high enough to perform the required system integration and testing, in collaboration with the team developing the research elements.
                The candidate will collaborate with several engineers to create revolutionary algorithms to scale up autonomous and resilient missions across different domains (including a preference for aerial but also ground and marine), withing dynamic and unstructured environments at high speeds.
