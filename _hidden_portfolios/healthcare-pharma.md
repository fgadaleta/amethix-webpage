project_overview: "Johnson & Johnson (J&J) is an American multinational corporation founded in 1886 that develops medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods. The disease interception unit advances a growing venture portfolio focused on intercepting diseases prior to onset."
problem_space: "In the process of innovation, from the lab to bringing new products to the market, the pharmaceutical group has required to investigate the conditions of their new market and define pricing strategies while taking into account production and distribution costs along the entire supply chain."
problem_solution: "Amethix Technologies has played a fundamental role in the interception of several diseases among which Ischaemic stroke,	using Real World Evidence (RWE) data. <br /> Involved in commercial projects that range from big data analytics to measuring the effectiveness of drugs outside of clinical trials, to social network analysis of clinicians and medical practitioners, to predicting risk of specific diseases. Amethix has designed and implemented powerful predictive models for disease interception, improving overall accuracy by +25% with respect to existing models. 		<p>
		More specifically Amethix has
		<ul>
		<li>implemented highly accurate predictive models for drug recommendation</li>
		<li>proposed and facilitated the adoption of Big Data technologies, advanced analytics and artificial intelligence solutions based on Deep Learning technology</li>
		<li>designed strategies to improve reproducibility in machine learning and production pipelines</li>
		</ul>
	</p> "
project_summary: "Amethix contribution has been fundamental to the Disease Interception Unit, moving J&J towards the right direction in the Big Data ecosystem of both the European and US markets."
